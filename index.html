    using HTML so we have to define it by using <!DOCTYPE html> to use HTML -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- This line defines two things, first is that this is where all your HTMl
    elements will be by using the element <html> but we are also defining 
    what is our main language of use for accomodation for text to speech
    so we use <html lang="en"> "en" for english-->
<html lang="en">

            "directoryname/filename" for the link to work -->
